	\file learn_fast_tree.cc Main file for the \p learn_fast_tree executable.  

    <tt> learn_fast_tree [--weight.</tt><i>x  weight</i><tt> ] ... \< </tt> \e infile \p \> \e outfile
    
    \p learn_fast_tree used ID3 to learn a ternary decision tree for corner
    detection. The data is read from the standard input, and the tree is written
    to the standard output. This is designed to learn FAST feature detectors,
    and does not allow for the possibility ambbiguity in the input data.

    \section lfInput Input data

    The input data has the following format:

\verbatim

5
[-1 -1] [1 1] [3 4] [5 6] [-3 4]
bbbbb 1     0
bsdsb 1000  1
.
.
.
\endverbatim
    
    The first row is the number of features. The second row is the the list of
    offsets assosciated with each feature. This list has no effect on the
    learning of the tree, but it is passed through to the outpur for
    convinience.

    The remaining rows contain the data. The first field is the ternary feature
    vector. The three characters "b", "d" and "s" are the correspond to
    brighter, darker and similar respectively, with the first feature being
    stored in the first character and so on.

    The next field is the number of instances of the particular feature.
    The third field is the class, with 1 for corner, and 0 for background.



\subsection f9Generate Generating input data
    
    Ideally, input data will be generated from some sample images. The 
    program FIXME can be used to do this.

    Additionally, a the program fast_N_features can be used to generate all 
    possible feature combinations for FAST-N features. When run without
    arguments, it generates data for FAST-9 features, otherwise the argument can
    be used to specify N.

\section lfGen Output data
    
    The program does not generate source code directly, rather it generates an
    easily parsabel representation of a decision tree which can be turned in to
    source code.

    The structure of the tree is described in detail in ::print_tree.

\e feature_number refers to the index of the feature that the test is performed on.

In \e node3, a 3 way test is performed. \e n1, \e n2 and \e n3 refer to the
number of training examples landing in the \e if block, the \e elfs block and
the \e else block respectivly.

In a \e node2 node, one of the tests has been removed. \e n1 and  \e n2refer to
the number of training examples landing in the \e if block and the \e else
block respectivly.

Although not mentioned in the grammar, the indenting is kept very strict.

This representation has been designed to be parsed very easily with simple
regular expressions, hence the use if "elsf" as opposed to "elif" or "elseif".
